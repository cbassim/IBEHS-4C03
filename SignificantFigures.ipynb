    "- captive zeros are between two nonzero digits and are always significant (i.e., 1008.02 has six sign. figs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- trailing zeros are significant only if a number contains a decimal point (i.e., 1200 has two sign. figs. (but could mean 1200. which has 4 sign. fig);  1200.00 has six sign. figs.)\n",
